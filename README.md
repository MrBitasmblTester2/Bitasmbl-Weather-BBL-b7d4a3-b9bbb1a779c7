# Bitasmbl-Weather-BBL-b7d4a3-b9bbb1a779c7

## Description
Build a web application that displays current weather, multi-day forecasts, and visualizes trends with charts. The project focuses on integrating APIs, dynamic front-end updates, and data visualization for an interactive user experience.

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Express.js
- React

## Requirements
- Fetch real-time weather data from a public API
- Display multi-day weather forecasts with clear UI elements
- Visualize temperature, humidity, or other metrics with charts
- Support user interactions, such as searching by city
- Optionally cache API responses to improve performance

## Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/MrBitasmblTester2/Bitasmbl-Weather-BBL-b7d4a3-b9bbb1a779c7.git
cd Bitasmbl-Weather-BBL-b7d4a3-b9bbb1a779c7


## Usage
Use Java, Express.js, and React tooling to build and run the application.

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up React UI for current weather, forecast, charts, and city search.
2. Implement Express.js routes to call the public weather API.
3. Integrate React with Express.js endpoints for dynamic updates.
4. Add chart components to visualize selected metrics.
5. Implement optional caching logic in the backend.
6. Use Java where appropriate in the application workflow.
